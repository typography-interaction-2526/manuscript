						<h2>A Handmade Web</h2>

					<p>The term <em>handmade</em> usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.</p>
					<p><strong>I evoke the term <em>handmade web</em> to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</strong></p>
					<p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. <em>Handmade</em> is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period.</p>
					<p>In her essay, <cite><a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/"><em>A Vernacular Web</em> (2005)</a></cite>, Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>[B]right, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>I evoke the term <em>handmade web</em> in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Make no <em>little</em> plans. They have no magic to stir [our] blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our [children and grandchildren] are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big.</p>
